# Creating a Lumina Project

To create a new Lumina project, use

```bash
$ lumina init my-awesome-project/
$ cd my-awesome-project/
$ lumina run
Hello World!
```

Lumina also ships with a code formatter. 

```bash
$ lumina fmt --overwrite my-awersome-project/
```

It's currently experimental so don't use it for code you don't have a backup off.
